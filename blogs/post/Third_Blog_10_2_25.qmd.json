My goal wasn’t to produce official population estimates; it was to practice the full pipeline and make an interesting blog using the template from task A. So this involved pulling multiple NHANES components, cleaning and recoding the variables, and presenting clear, unweighted descriptive summaries. All of these can be found in the submission file on Canvas. It took me more time to make sure the xpt files could be properly translated into excel files but I succeed despite being in despair.\n\n## Three NHANES Variables\n\nI combined three NHANES files, all linked by the participant ID (SEQN):\n\nDemographics (P_DEMO): age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income-to-poverty ratio, plus the survey design variables I’ll use later.\n\nHDL laboratory (P_HDL): HDL cholesterol in mg/dL — that’s my outcome.\n\nFood Security (P_FSQ): household food security categories — this is the third source to meet the project requirement and to see whether HDL differs by food security status.\n\n## How I cleaned the variables\n\nNHANES uses labeled codes, so I first converted “refused/don’t know” numeric codes (e.g., 77, 99, etc.) to missing. For the rest I made main recodes:\n\nEducation: I turned DMDEDUC2 into a 4-level factor: LessHS, HS/GED, SomeCollege, College+.\n\nFood security: I started from the released household category (FSDHH: High, Marginal, Low, Very low). For a cleaner display I also made a 3-level version, fs_cat = Marginal/High, Low, Very low (collapsing High+Marginal together).\n\nHDL: I kept HDL in mg/dL and filtered to the age range above.\n\nI also carried the design variables and MEC weights through the pipeline so I can use them later, even though this task only asks for unweighted descriptives.\n\n## What’s on the dashboard?\n\nThe dashboard reads prepared Excel sheets and shows three things:\n\nKPIs (Key Performance Indicator): total N, HDL non-missing N, and the overall mean/SD of HDL.\n\nVisualization 1 – HDL by education: A faceted histogram so I can actually see the distribution of HDL within each education group (not just the average). This includes both a histogram comparison and the table 1 that includes the Means and SD of HDL by Education as well as the n values.\n\nTable 2 – HDL by food security: A simple bar chart of mean HDL across Marginal/High, Low, and Very low food security, plus a small table with mean and SD. This explicitly uses the Food Security file so the third dataset is represented in the results, not just the merge.\n\n## What I’m seeing\nThe KPIs confirm I’m working with a solid sample of MEC-examined adults and a large subset with valid HDL. The education display suggests a familiar pattern: groups with more education tend to have slightly higher average HDL. The food security display also shows a trend. Households classified as Very low food security tend to have lower mean HDL than the Marginal/High category. These are descriptive differences only but they’re consistent with what I’d expect from social determinants of health. Education is a huge predictor of health outcomes and even consistent upkeep with health is shown through the data. \n\n## What I didn’t do\nPer the assignment, I kept these summaries unweighted and didn’t report standard errors or confidence intervals.\n\n## What I’d do next\nIf I were extending this, I’d (1) re-run the summaries using the survey design for weighted means and CIs, and (2) fit adjusted models (e.g., mean HDL ~ education + food security + age + sex + race/ethnicity + PIR) to see whether the patterns hold after accounting for obvious confounders. I’d also split food security into adult vs household if needed. Finally I'd explore whether results change by sex or age group just to see what's going on with the demographics.\n\n## Takeaway and Final Thoughts\nThis task was about building me a work flow into my already established website. The thing is it took a lot of time and was a lot of work. Pulling multiple NHNANES components, cleaning them correctly, creating outputs, and then connecting them to the dashboard? Quite difficult. but luckily I finished it even though it took me a little longer.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":false,"reference-location":"margin","output-file":"Third_Blog_10_2_25.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
