I am both a bioethicist and a biomedical engineer! I am currently getting my PhD in Bioethics. I am a fourth generation farmer, born in Alabama but raised in Ohio. My family has taugh me importance of three things: 1. Education 2. Tenacity 3. Community And so I spent my younger years getting my Bachelor’s of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Physics from Cleveland State University. I also gained my Biomedical Engineering Masters of Science degree from Case Western Reserve. On this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles, code for git-hub, and a blog. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life’s work. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

I was using Google to help with this as it always had a code response that could help me and explanation behind the code. Really just asking questions on how to set up these different parts of the project I tried to set up. Unfortunately I was still having problems. The biggest one? I was not able to connect the data to my inhouse computer for some reason. Update: I soon realized I forgot a step of reseting up my excel document. So all my excel documents were empty. As I had to regenerate them from a previous attempt (long story short, it drove me insane). So instead of doing all that again, because it took some time and it is 8:45pm at night, I just accepted the L on this one and turned it in."

My goal wasn’t to produce official population estimates; it was to practice the full pipeline and make an interesting blog using the template from task A. So this involved pulling multiple NHANES components, cleaning and recoding the variables, and presenting clear, unweighted descriptive summaries. All of these can be found in the submission file on Canvas. It took me more time to make sure the xpt files could be properly translated into excel files but I succeed despite being in despair."

For the rest I made main recodes:\nEducation: I turned DMDEDUC2 into a 4-level factor: LessHS, HS/GED, SomeCollege, College+.\nFood security: I started from the released household category (FSDHH: High, Marginal, Low, Very low). For a cleaner display I also made a 3-level version, fs_cat = Marginal/High, Low, Very low (collapsing High+Marginal together).\nHDL: I kept HDL in mg/dL and filtered to the age range above.\nI also carried the design variables and MEC weights through the pipeline so I can use them later, even though this task only asks for unweighted descriptives."

This includes both a histogram comparison and the table 1 that includes the Means and SD of HDL by Education as well as the n values.\nTable 2 – HDL by food security: A simple bar chart of mean HDL across Marginal/High, Low, and Very low food security, plus a small table with mean and SD. This explicitly uses the Food Security file so the third dataset is represented in the results, not just the merge."

    "section": "What I’m seeing",
    "text": "What I’m seeing\nThe KPIs confirm I’m working with a solid sample of MEC-examined adults and a large subset with valid HDL. The education display suggests a familiar pattern: groups with more education tend to have slightly higher average HDL. The food security display also shows a trend. Households classified as Very low food security tend to have lower mean HDL than the Marginal/High category. These are descriptive differences only but they’re consistent with what I’d expect from social determinants of health. Education is a huge predictor of health outcomes and even consistent upkeep with health is shown through the data."

I’d also split food security into adult vs household if needed. Finally I’d explore whether results change by sex or age group just to see what’s going on with the demographics."
