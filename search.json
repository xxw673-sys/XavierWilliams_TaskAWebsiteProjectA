    "text": "title: “Blog 2 - Oof” date: 2025-09-29 categories: [Project A, Task B NHANES] Second Blog - Gotta say ya’ll this was tough. I got pretty far but in truth needed to throw in the towel. I was using Google to help with this as it always had a code response that could help me and explanation behind the code. Really just asking questions on how to set up these different parts of the project I tried to set up. Unfortunately I was still having problems. The biggest one? I was not able to connect the data to my inhouse computer for some reason. Update: I soon realized I forgot a step of reseting up my excel document. So all my excel documents were empty. As I had to regenerate them from a previous attempt (long story short, it drove me insane). So instead of doing all that again, because it took some time and it is 8:45pm at night, I just accepted the L on this one and turned it in."

I used the Marvin Schmitt template here - https://marvin-schmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/#setting-up-your-website-with-quarto\nI then googled a few things like how to edit the color and how to move around/use images throughout the index files. I created a “first blog file” (this one) that was a copy of one of the index files from Marvin and WAMO! I got it. This was quite time consuming."

I am both a bioethicist and a biomedical engineer! I am currently getting my PhD in Bioethics. I am a fourth generation farmer, born in Alabama but raised in Ohio. My family has taugh me importance of three things: 1. Education 2. Tenacity 3. Community And so I spent my younger years getting my Bachelor’s of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Physics from Cleveland State University. I also gained my Biomedical Engineering Masters of Science degree from Case Western Reserve. On this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles, code for git-hub, and a blog. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life’s work. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
